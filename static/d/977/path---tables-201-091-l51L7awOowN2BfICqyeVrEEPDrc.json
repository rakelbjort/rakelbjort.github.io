Also in this situation, it is only acceptable to use this code because it is such a small table.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;table>\n    &#x3C;tr>\n        &#x3C;th>Date&#x3C;/th>\n        &#x3C;td>1 April&#x3C;/td>\n        &#x3C;td>17 August&#x3C;/td>\n        &#x3C;td>20 April&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;/tr>\n    &#x3C;tr>\n        &#x3C;th>What's happening?&#x3C;/th>\n        &#x3C;td>Going to get coffee&#x3C;/td>\n        &#x3C;td>Going for a run&#x3C;/td>\n        &#x3C;td>Going to get a tattoo!&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;/tr>\n    &#x3C;tr>\n        &#x3C;th>Where ?&#x3C;/th>\n        &#x3C;td>At a cat cafe&#x3C;/td>\n        &#x3C;td>Outside&#x3C;/td>\n        &#x3C;td>In prison&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;/tr>\n&#x3C;/table>\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Table with ambiguous data</h3>\n<p>Now we have data (first name, last name, city) that can't be distinguished from one another without knowing which header each corresponds to. The <code>scope</code> attribute with the value <code>col</code> defines the direction of the header cells and associates them with the corresponding data cells. The <code>scope</code> attribute is also needed for larger tables with one header row or column.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;table>\n  &#x3C;caption>Teddy bear collectors:&#x3C;/caption>\n  &#x3C;tr>\n    &#x3C;th scope=\"col\">Last Name&#x3C;/th>\n    &#x3C;th scope=\"col\">First Name&#x3C;/th>\n    &#x3C;th scope=\"col\">City&#x3C;/th>\n  &#x3C;/tr>\n  &#x3C;tr>\n    &#x3C;td>Bunny&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;td>Bugs&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;td>NY&#x3C;/td>\n  &#x3C;/tr>\n  &#x3C;tr>\n    &#x3C;td>Rabbit&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;td>Peter&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;td>Chicago&#x3C;/td>\n  &#x3C;/tr>\n  &#x3C;tr>\n    &#x3C;td>Rabbit&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;td>Roger&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;td>LA&#x3C;/td>\n  &#x3C;/tr>\n&#x3C;/table>\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Tables with two headers</h2>\n<p>For this type of tables we use the <code>&#x3C;ht></code> element to identify the header cells and the <code>scope</code> attribute to declare the direction of each header. The <code>scope</code>attribute can be set to <code>row</code> or <code>col</code> to denote the that a header applies to the entire row or column, respectively.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can use the <code>&#x3C;caption></code> element to identify the table in a document. This is particularly useful for screen reader users browsing the web page in \"table mode\" where they can navigate from table to table.</p>\n<h4>Table with header cells in the top row and first column</h4>\n<p>All header cells are marked up as the <code>&#x3C;th></code> cells with <code>scope</code> attributes added.</p>\n<p>In the header row, the <code>col</code> value for <code>scope</code> associates each header cells with the data cells in the column. In the header column, the <code>row</code> calue associates the individual headers with their rows.\nWithout this information, some users would not easily understand the relationship between header and data cells.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;table>\n  &#x3C;caption>Delivery slots:&#x3C;/caption>\n  &#x3C;tr>\n    &#x3C;td>&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;th scope=\"col\">Monday&#x3C;/th>\n    &#x3C;th scope=\"col\">Tuesday&#x3C;/th>\n    &#x3C;th scope=\"col\">Wednesday&#x3C;/th>\n    &#x3C;th scope=\"col\">Thursday&#x3C;/th>\n    &#x3C;th scope=\"col\">Friday&#x3C;/th>\n  &#x3C;/tr>\n  &#x3C;tr>\n    &#x3C;th scope=\"row\">09:00 - 11:00&#x3C;/th>\n    &#x3C;td>Closed&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;td>Open&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;td>Open&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;td>Closed&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;td>Closed&#x3C;/td>\n  &#x3C;/tr>\n  &#x3C;tr>\n    &#x3C;th scope=\"row\">11:00 - 13:00&#x3C;/th>\n    &#x3C;td>Open&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;td>Open&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;td>Closed&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;td>Closed&#x3C;/td>\n    &#x3C;td>Closed&#x3C;/td>\n  &#x3C;/tr>\n  […]\n&#x3C;/table>\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Table with an offset column of header cells</h4>\n<p>In this example the row header cells are in the second rather than in the first column.</p>\n<p>The scope of the header cells in the top row is set to <code>col</code>. By using the <code>row</code> value for <code>scope</code> assigns the header cells in the second column to the data cells on the left and the right of the individual header cell.</p>\n<pre><code>[…]\n&#x3C;tr>\n  &#x3C;td>215&#x3C;/td>\n  &#x3C;th scope=\"row\">Abel&#x3C;/th>\n  &#x3C;td>5&#x3C;/td>\n  &#x3C;td>2&#x3C;/td>\n  &#x3C;td>0&#x3C;/td>\n  &#x3C;td>0&#x3C;/td>\n  &#x3C;td>0&#x3C;/td>\n  &#x3C;td>3&#x3C;/td>\n&#x3C;/tr>\n[…]\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Tables with irregular headers</h2>\n<p>These examples are with header cells that span multiple columns and/or rows. Several elements and attributes can be used to degine the structure and relationships of the header and data cells.</p>\n<p>For example, a header cell that spans three columns should be associated with corresponding data cells in the column group. This can be done by setting the <code>scope</code> attribute of the header cell to the value <code>colgroup</code>. The same principle applies to header cells spanning multiple rows. In this case, they are associated with by using the value <code>rowgroup</code> in the <code>scope</code> attribute.</p>\n<p>However, before making these associations, the structure of such groups of columns and rows needs to be defined in the table markup:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A column group is defined using the <code>&#x3C;colgroup></code> element.</li>\n<li>A row group is defined by the <code>&#x3C;thead></code>, <code>&#x3C;tfoot></code> and <code>&#x3C;tbody></code> elements.</li>\n<li><code>&#x3C;thead></code> and <code>&#x3C;tfoot></code> elements can be used once in a table.</li>\n<li>A table can have any number of <code>&#x3C;tbody></code> elements that each defines a row group.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Table with two tier headers</h3>\n<p>Here there are two pairs of column headers. Each pair of column headers, \"Produced\" and \"Sold\" is associated with a first-level header that identifies the pair: \"Mars\" and \"Venus\". These first-level headers are made to span two columns by using the <code>colspan</code> element instead of that number of <code>&#x3C;col></code> elements, and the number of columns spanned is noted in the <code>span</code> attribute.</p>\n<p>Also, the value of the <code>scope</code> attribute in the first-level headers is set to <code>colgroup</code> so that it is associated with the entire group of columns. The second-level headers only apply to the corresponding column, so the <code>scope</code> attribute is set to <code>col</code>.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/tables","title":"Tables"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"9d83eb8c-14a3-54a7-b1c6-1910b01704d9","excerpt":"We, the developers, are always trying to write clean code and keep in mind that other developers will have to read through our code, understand it and able to work in it.
